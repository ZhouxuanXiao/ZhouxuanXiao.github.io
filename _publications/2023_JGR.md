<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Chinaâ€™s first Mars rover, Zhurong, has carried out an exploration mission in southern Utopian Plainitia. As rocks and their three-dimensional (3D) morphology are essential for studying the geological characteristics of the Martian surface, this paper presents an approach for automatically extracting 3D rocks from stereo rover images. With our approach, 6,185 centimeter-scale rocks are extracted using the Zhurong NaTeCams images, with the F1-score achieving 91.86%. Approximate 3D morphological features are then calculated for each rock, and the statistical result shows that small rocks in centimeters make up the majority. Comparative morphological analyses of rocks in different areas show that landscape type affects the number of rocks but has no clear relationship to the proportions of rocks of different sizes. The outcrops of sedimentary rocks, the predominant type of rocks in the Zhurong landing area, and the float rocks are distributed differently regarding all morphological features, making the size-frequency distribution of rocks around craters significantly different from other areas. Further comparative analysis with the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks extracted from the Spirit rover data is also conducted. Some similarities between the Zhurong outcrop rocks and the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks are found in 2D compactness. Meanwhile, the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks have a more scattered distribution in sphericity than both the float and outcrop rocks in the Zhurong landing area, indicating that the shapes of the Bonneville crater ejecta rocks may be more diverse. In addition, the sphericity is found to converge with height for rocks in both landing areas.</p>
